# Scheduled Risk Analysis for Capital Projects using AI

# What if we can have AI generate risk profiles of construction project schedules in real time ?


This repository contains an **experimental presentation** designed to display the use case of generative AI to perform **risk analysis for capital projects** through AI-powered scheduling insights


## Problem Statement

Capital projects often suffer from **cost overruns, schedule delays, and unmanaged risks** due to poor visibility into evolving schedule complexities. 
Traditional risk analysis methods are manual, time-consuming, and often limited to **static point-in-time assessments**

**ContinuousAI-assisted risk monitoring** enable project teams to:

- Detect emerging schedule risks early
- Understand potential impacts of schedule changes
- Receive automated, **scheduled risk reports** based on dynamic project data


- **Scheduled Risk Reports:**

## Roadmap
- [ ] **AI-Driven Risk Scoring:** index historical risk patterns in a RAG pipeline.
- [ ] **Automated Schedule Ingestion:** Seamlessly fetches schedule updates from common scheduling tools
- [ ] **Customizable Risk Criteria:** Adaptable to organization-specific risk factors and project requirements
- [ ] **Audit Trail & Historical Analysis:** Tracks evolving risk profiles across the project lifecycle
- [ ] Add support for direct Primavera P6 and MS Project integration
- [ ] Enhance AI models with **LLM-based schedule description analysis**
