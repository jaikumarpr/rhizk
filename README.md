# Scheduled Risk Analysis for Capital Projects using AI

# What if we can have AI generate risk profiles for construction project in real time ?


This repository contains an **experimental solution** designed to automate and enhance **risk analysis for capital projects** through AI-powered scheduling insights. The solution leverages **AI models** to analyze project schedules, identify potential risks, and generate periodic risk reports â€” providing project teams with proactive risk visibility throughout the project lifecycle.


## Problem Statement

Capital projects often suffer from **cost overruns, schedule delays, and unmanaged risks** due to poor visibility into evolving schedule complexities. Traditional risk analysis methods are manual, time-consuming, and often limited to **static point-in-time assessments**. This solution aims to shift the paradigm towards **continuous, AI-assisted risk monitoring**, enabling project teams to:

- Detect emerging schedule risks early.
- Understand potential impacts of schedule changes.
- Receive automated, **scheduled risk reports** based on dynamic project data.


## Key Features

- **AI-Driven Risk Scoring:** Identifies high-risk activities and predicts potential delays using historical risk patterns.
- **Scheduled Risk Reports:**

## Roadmap
- [ ] **Automated Schedule Ingestion:** Seamlessly fetches schedule updates from common scheduling tools.
- [ ] **Customizable Risk Criteria:** Adaptable to organization-specific risk factors and project requirements.
- [ ] **Audit Trail & Historical Analysis:** Tracks evolving risk profiles across the project lifecycle.
- [ ] Add support for direct Primavera P6 and MS Project integration.
- [ ] Enhance AI models with **LLM-based schedule description analysis**.
